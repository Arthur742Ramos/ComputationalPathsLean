- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Keep `main` (UNCONFIRMED) building warning-free while reducing/discharging Lean `assumption`/`by_cases`/axiom usage related to `SVK` (UNCONFIRMED meaning of SVK).
  - Commit and push incremental progress as build stays green.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow repo `AGENTS.md`: run `.\lake.cmd build` after non-trivial edits; zero-warning policy.
  - Prefer small, incremental proof refactors; do not fix unrelated issues.
- Key decisions:
  - Start/maintain this Continuity Ledger in `CONTINUITY.md` (was missing).
- State:
  - Done:
    - Created `CONTINUITY.md`.
    - `.\lake.cmd build` succeeds on current working tree (172 jobs; no warnings observed).
  - Now:
    - Commit and push current changes (working tree modified; build green).
  - Next:
    - Locate `SVK`-related assumptions and attempt to discharge them.
    - Rebuild (`.\lake.cmd build`) and keep warning-free; commit/push incremental progress.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - What does `SVK` stand for in this codebase, and which files/lemmas are in scope?
  - Are we targeting a specific branch/remote (assume `origin` unless configured otherwise)?
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - Files: `CONTINUITY.md`, `ComputationalPaths/Path/HIT/WedgeSVKAxiom.lean` (and other modified HIT files; see `git status`).
  - Commands: `git status`, `git diff`, `git commit`, `git push`, `rg -n \"SVK\"`, `rg -n \"assumption\"`, `.\u005clake.cmd build`.
