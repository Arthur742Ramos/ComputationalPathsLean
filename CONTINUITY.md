# CONTINUITY.md
## Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Add clarifying documentation in Core/Univalence and top-level docs to distinguish computational paths from HoTT identity types and address reviewer misunderstandings.

## Constraints/Assumptions:
- Update `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Core.lean` and `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Univalence.lean` with documentation clarifying Path semantics, steps metadata, UIP intent, and HoTT differences.
- Consider adding README section or DESIGN doc explaining philosophy.

## Key decisions:
- None yet.

## State:
- Done:
  - Read `CONTINUITY.md`.
  - Read `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Core.lean` and `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Univalence.lean`.
  - Added clarifying docs in `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Core.lean`, `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Univalence.lean`, and `README.md`.
- Now:
  - Review changes for consistency with reviewer concerns.
- Next:
  - None.

## Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- None.

## Working set (files/ids/commands):
- Files: `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Core.lean`, `ComputationalPaths/Path/Basic/Univalence.lean`, `README.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`.
- Commands: none.
