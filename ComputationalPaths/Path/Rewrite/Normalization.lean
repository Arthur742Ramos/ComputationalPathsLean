# Normalization of computational paths

Defines normal forms for `Path` by collapsing to the canonical witness of the
underlying propositional equality.

## Key Results

- `IsNormal` and `normalize`
- `NormalForm` and `normalizeForm`
- Normalization interacts with `trans`, `symm`, `congrArg`, `ofEq`
- Normal forms are unique representatives of the toEq equivalence class
- Decidability of normality
- Transport through normal forms
