# Path Algebra — algebraic structure of computational paths

The groupoid-like structure on `Path`: composition (`trans`), inverse (`symm`),
identity (`refl`), together with path length, step operations, and the subpath
relation.  Core already establishes the basic groupoid laws; here we develop
the remaining algebraic infrastructure.

## Main results

- `length` and its interaction with `trans`, `symm`, `refl`, `congrArg`
- Cancellation laws for `trans`/`symm` at the *step-list* level
- Subpath relation (`IsPrefix`, `IsSuffix`) and their properties
- Path concatenation monoid structure
- Step-count invariants and injectivity results
