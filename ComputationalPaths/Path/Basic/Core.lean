# Basic combinators for computational paths (core)

Core definitions for computational paths: we introduce elementary rewrite
steps, package them into paths, and record the foundational operations
(`refl`, `symm`, `trans`) together with transport/substitution infrastructure.

Important: `Path` is a structure that *records* a propositional equality
(`proof : a = b`) plus a list of rewrite steps as metadata.  The equality
semantics are given entirely by the `proof` field (Lean's `Eq` in `Prop`, hence
UIP/proof-irrelevance), while the `steps` list preserves a trace for the
computational-path rewriting system.  This is *not* the HoTT identity type: we
do not treat `Path` as a higher inductive identity, and we intentionally rely
on UIP to keep coherence proofs proof-irrelevant.
