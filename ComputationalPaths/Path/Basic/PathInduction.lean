# Path Induction — eliminators and recursion for computational paths

We develop induction principles for `Path`: a J-like eliminator, based path
induction, path recursion, and transport-based substitution.  Because our
`Path` records an `Eq`-proof together with a step trace, the induction
principles decompose into an appeal to the inner `proof` field (which is just
`Eq`) and reconstruction of the step metadata.

## Main results

- `Path.pathInd` — the J-eliminator for the proof component.
- `Path.basedPathInd` — based path induction fixing one endpoint.
- `Path.pathRec` — recursion out of paths into an arbitrary type.
- Various computation rules and uniqueness principles.
- Transport lemmas derived from the induction structure.

/-! ## J-eliminator (path induction on Eq) -/

/-- The J-eliminator for the equality component of paths. Given a motive
`C : ∀ (b : A), a = b → Sort v` and a proof that `C a rfl` holds,
we derive `C b h` for any `h : a = b`. -/
def pathInd {C : ∀ (b : A), a = b → Sort v}
    (base : C a rfl)
