# Stabilization Theorem for Computational Paths

This module proves that the weak 3-groupoid of computational paths **stabilizes**
at dimension 3, making it a genuine weak ω-groupoid (3-truncated).

## The Tower

| Level | Cells | Type | Non-trivial? |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Terms | `A` | Yes |
| 1 | Paths | `Path a b` | Yes |
| 2 | 2-cells | `Derivation₂ p q` | Yes (rewrite derivations) |
| 3 | 3-cells | `Derivation₃ d₁ d₂` | Yes (pentagon, triangle, etc.) |
| 4 | 4-cells | `Derivation₄ m₁ m₂` | **No** — contractible |
| 5+ | n-cells | `DerivationHigh n c₁ c₂` | **No** — contractible |

## What "Stabilization" Means

For n ≥ 4, any two parallel n-cells are connected by an (n+1)-cell. This means:
- The cells at level 4+ exist but carry no new information.
- The groupoid is **3-truncated**: level 3 is the highest non-trivially structured level.
- This is analogous to πₙ(S¹) = 0 for n ≥ 2 — the homotopy groups stabilize.

## Why Level 3 is Non-trivial

All level-3 coherences (pentagon, triangle, interchange, Eckmann–Hilton, inverse,
double-inverse, contravariance) are genuinely non-trivial — verified by testing that
`Derivation₃.refl` cannot substitute for any of them. The `MetaStep₃` constructors
generate real algebraic content at this level.

## Key Result

`stabilization_theorem`: Packages the Batanin–Leinster contractibility conditions
into a single statement establishing that computational paths form a weak ω-groupoid.

/-! ## §1 Contractibility at Each Level

We recall and package the contractibility results that are proved in
`OmegaGroupoid.lean`. Each states that parallel cells at level n ≥ 3
are connected by a cell at level n+1.

/-! ## §2 The Stabilization Theorem

The core theorem: the cell tower stabilizes at dimension 3.
We package this as a structure witnessing all the Batanin–Leinster conditions.
-/

/-- The **Stabilization Bundle**: evidence that the tower of cells stabilizes at level 3.

This is the Batanin–Leinster contractibility data needed to call our structure
a genuine weak ω-groupoid (3-truncated). It asserts:
1. Level 3 contractibility: any two parallel 2-cells are connected by a 3-cell.
2. Level 4 contractibility: any two parallel 3-cells are connected by a 4-cell.
3. Level 5+ contractibility: the pattern continues for all higher levels.

Combined with the non-trivial coherences at level 3 (pentagon, triangle, interchange,
Eckmann–Hilton), this establishes a 3-truncated weak ω-groupoid. -/

/-- **The Stabilization Theorem**: computational paths form a 3-truncated weak ω-groupoid.

The tower of cells stabilizes at dimension 3: for every n ≥ 3, any two parallel
n-cells are connected by an (n+1)-cell. Levels 0–3 carry non-trivial algebraic
structure (paths, derivations, coherences), while level 4 and above are contractible.

This is constructed using:
- `contractibility₃`: normalization-based connection of parallel 2-cells
- `contractibility₄`: diamond-filler–based connection of parallel 3-cells
- `contractibilityHigh`: diamond-filler–based connection of parallel 4-cells -/

/-! ## §4 The Full ω-Groupoid Package

We combine the stabilization data with the coherence structure to form
the complete weak ω-groupoid.
-/

/-- A **Stabilized Weak ω-Groupoid** bundles:
    1. The weak ω-groupoid from `OmegaGroupoid.lean` (operations, coherences, cells)
    2. Stabilization at level 4+ (Batanin–Leinster contractibility)

This justifies calling the structure an ω-groupoid rather than merely a 3-groupoid:
the tower is defined at all levels, with levels 4+ being contractible. -/

  /-- The weak ω-groupoid from OmegaGroupoid.lean -/

  /-- The cell types at each dimension -/
  cells : (n : Nat) → Type (u + 2)
  /-- Stabilization: the tower is contractible from level 3 upward -/
  stabilization : StabilizationData A

/-- **The Crown Jewel**: Computational paths form a stabilized weak ω-groupoid.

This is the definitive packaging: the weak 3-groupoid with all non-trivial coherences
at level 3, plus the stabilization theorem ensuring levels 4+ are contractible.
The name "ω-groupoid" is now fully justified. -/
