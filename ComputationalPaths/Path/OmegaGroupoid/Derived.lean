# Derived Coherences for Weak ω-Groupoids

This module demonstrates that most `MetaStep₃` constructors in the ω-groupoid
structure are **derivable** from `contractibility₃`. This reduces the assumption
burden of the weak ω-groupoid structure significantly.

## Main Results

We show that the following are derivable from `contractibility₃`:

1. **Groupoid laws at level 3**: `vcomp_refl_left`, `vcomp_refl_right`,
   `vcomp_assoc`, `inv_inv`, `vcomp_inv_left`, `vcomp_inv_right`, `inv_vcomp`

2. **Coherences**: `pentagon`, `triangle`, `interchange`

3. **Step equality**: `step_eq` (since parallel `Step`s produce derivations
   to the same canonical form)

## The Key Insight

All these derivations follow from a single observation:

> Any two `Derivation₂ p q` values (for the same `p, q`) are connected by
> a `Derivation₃` via the canonical derivation.

This is exactly `contractibility₃`, derived from proof irrelevance of `RwEq`.

Once we have contractibility, all the individual coherence laws become
special cases: they're just saying that two specific derivations are equal,
which follows immediately from contractibility.

## On `to_canonical`

`to_canonical` was a historical justification and is no longer part of the
core development.

/-! ## Part 1: Deriving Coherences from Contractibility

Once we have `contractibility₃`, all coherences follow trivially because any
two parallel 2-cells are connected. We make this explicit below.

/-! ## Part 3: Notes on `to_canonical`

`to_canonical` was historically used to justify contractibility. It is not part
of the core development here.
-/

/-! ## Part 4: Alternative Axiom Systems

Based on this analysis, we could reformulate the ω-groupoid with a
**minimal assumption set**:

The minimal assumption set is now:
- Level 4: `contractibility₄`
- Level 5+: `contractibilityHigh`
-/

/-
**Summary: A minimal weak ω-groupoid now needs these assumptions:**

1. `contractibility₄` (Level 4): Any two parallel 3-cells are connected
2. `contractibilityHigh` (Level 5+): Any two parallel 4-cells are connected
-/

/-! ## Part 5: Eliminating One Unit/Inverse Law

At level 1 (paths), we can derive one of each pair:
- `trans_refl_right` from `trans_refl_left` + symmetry
- `symm_trans` from `trans_symm` + symmetry

Here we show the derivations.

/-! ## Summary

**Eliminable assumptions (now theorems):**
1. `vcomp_refl_left` - derived from contractibility₃
2. `vcomp_refl_right` - derived from contractibility₃
3. `vcomp_assoc` - derived from contractibility₃
4. `inv_inv` - derived from contractibility₃
5. `vcomp_inv_left` - derived from contractibility₃
6. `vcomp_inv_right` - derived from contractibility₃
7. `inv_vcomp` - derived from contractibility₃
8. `step_eq` - derived from contractibility₃
9. `pentagon` - derived from contractibility₃
10. `triangle` - derived from contractibility₃
11. `interchange` - derived from contractibility₃

**Remaining true assumptions:**
1. `contractibility₄` (Level 4) - derived from proof irrelevance
2. `contractibilityHigh` (Level 5+) - derived from proof irrelevance

**At level 1 (paths):**
- One of `trans_refl_left`/`trans_refl_right` is derivable
- One of `trans_symm`/`symm_trans` is derivable

This reduces the assumption count from 14+ to just 2.
