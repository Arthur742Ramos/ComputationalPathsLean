# Codex Notes (ComputationalPaths)

This folder contains lightweight “prompt recipes” for working effectively with Codex CLI in this repo.

- Prefer the canonical agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`.
- The more detailed assistant documentation lives in `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/`.
- The files in `.codex/skills/` are short, task-focused checklists intended to reduce repeated prompting.
