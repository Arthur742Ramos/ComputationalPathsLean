**File reviewed:** `bsl_main.tex` (190 KB, ~4,300 lines)
**Codebase checked:** `ComputationalPathsLean/ComputationalPaths/`

## Executive Summary

This is an ambitious paper presenting a comprehensive theory of computational paths — equality proofs enriched with explicit rewrite traces — culminating in a weak ω-groupoid structure with contractibility at dimension ≥ 3. The mathematical framework is original and well-motivated. However, the paper has **several serious issues** that must be addressed before BSL submission:

1. **Codebase statistics are significantly outdated** (theorem count off by 3×)
2. **The rule count "75" is wrong** — the actual `Step` inductive has 77 constructors
3. **30 instances of Lean-specific syntax leak** (`\texttt{HasJoinOfRw}`, `.lean` filenames, etc.)
4. **The `UseOfGAI` declaration says "Not used"** — this needs honest reassessment
5. **The paper is extremely long** for BSL (~50+ pages) and may exceed length limits
6. **The formalization status table is stale** (0 sorries exist, yet some items marked "PS")

---

## 1. Statistics Accuracy — CRITICAL

### Actual codebase statistics (as of 2026-02-15):

| Metric | Paper claims | Actual | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source files | 856 | **905** | ❌ Outdated |
| Lines of code | 217,000 | **216,412** | ≈ OK (close) |
| Theorems | 3,532 | **10,493** (+ 73 lemmas = 10,566) | ❌ **Off by 3×** |
| Definitions | 8,191 | **9,008** | ❌ Outdated |
| Structures | 4,746 | **4,800** | ❌ Outdated |
| Inductive types | 327 | **417** | ❌ Outdated |
| Instances | (not listed) | 98 | — |
| Sorries | (not mentioned) | **0** | ✅ |

**The theorem count is the most egregious error.** The paper says 3,532 theorems; the codebase contains **10,493 `theorem` declarations and 73 `lemma` declarations**, totaling over 10,500. This is a 3× undercount. For a paper whose selling point is large-scale mechanized verification, getting this number wrong undermines credibility.

**Action required:** Update all statistics in Section 10.2 ("The Formalization") to current values. Consider adding the date of the snapshot.

### Rule count: "75 rules" is wrong

The paper consistently claims "75 rules" throughout (abstract, §3, appendix). The actual `Step` inductive in `Path/Rewrite/Step.lean` has **77 constructors**:

- The 75 rules as documented, plus:
  - `trans_cancel_left` (constructor #76)
  - `trans_cancel_right` (constructor #77)

These two cancellation rules are actually **mentioned in the confluence proof** (Section 3.6: "the groupoid fragment is completed with two algebraic cancellation rules (`trans_cancel_left/right`)") but are never counted in the "75 rules" figure. This is an internal contradiction.

The appendix (Appendix A) tries to address this in a remark at the end, noting that "context congruence (R31) appears in both Group IV and Group VIII" and that "two additional transport rules... were added after the original numbering was established." But the actual discrepancy is the two cancellation rules, not a double-counting of context congruence. The remark is confusing and does not resolve the contradiction.

**Action required:** Either:
- (a) Update the count to 77 throughout and document all rules, or
- (b) Explain precisely which rules are considered "primitive" vs. "derived" and why the count is 75 (but then remove `trans_cancel_left/right` from the `Step` inductive, which would break the confluence proof)

Option (a) is strongly recommended.

## 2. Mathematical Correctness

### Core definitions (Path, Step, refl, symm, trans) — ✅ Correct

The paper's definitions match `Path/Basic/Core.lean` precisely:
- `Path` is a structure with `steps : List (Step A)` and `proof : a = b` ✅
- `refl` uses empty list ✅
- `symm` reverses and maps `Step.symm` ✅
- `trans` concatenates lists ✅

### Strict monoid laws (Theorem 2.4) — ✅ Correct

These follow from list identities as claimed. The proofs are sound.

### Non-UIP theorem (Theorem 1.7) — ✅ Correct

The proof that `refl(a)` (empty step list) differs from `ofEq(refl)` (single-step list) is valid and does correctly demonstrate non-UIP for Path.

### Confluence proof architecture (Theorem 3.15) — ⚠️ Presentation concern

The paper says the confluence proof uses "a two-level architecture" with a "groupoid-algebraic argument" that avoids Newman's lemma. This is a strong and interesting claim. However, the exposition is somewhat terse — the actual structure of the `GroupoidConfluence` approach (interpreting into the free group and using reduced words) deserves more space, as it is one of the paper's genuine technical innovations. Currently it gets about 3 sentences in the proof of Theorem 3.15.

### Contractibility at dimension ≥ 3 (Theorem 5.11) — ✅ Correct but trivial

The proof that any two `Derivation₂(p,q)` are connected by a `Derivation₃` cell via the `RwEq`-coherence constructor is correct. As the paper honestly acknowledges (Remark 5.10), this is a consequence of proof irrelevance — not a deep topological fact. The paper handles this well.

### Eckmann–Hilton argument (Theorem 6.10) — ⚠️ Informal notation

The proof uses `≡₃` notation without formal definition. It appears to mean "connected by a `Derivation₃` cell," but this should be stated explicitly. Also, "Step 1" claims that "whiskering by refl(a) acts as the identity on Ω²-elements" with the justification that "trans(refl(a), refl(a)) reduces definitionally to refl(a)." This is true but the argument for why whiskering by refl is trivial *on arbitrary Ω² elements* (not just refl) needs more care.

### RwEq triviality (Remark 3.9) — ✅ Well-handled

This is the paper's most delicate point: in a UIP setting, *all* paths with the same endpoints are RwEq-equivalent, making RwEq the total relation. The remark handles this honestly, explaining that the value lies in the constructive witnesses (explicit rewrite sequences), not in the equivalence relation itself. This deserves prominent placement.

---

## 3. Consistency Issues

### Title: "Calculus" vs. "Algebra"

- The paper title says "The **Calculus** of Computational Paths"
- The `references.bib` file header says "The **Algebra** of Computational Paths"
- The Lean repository reference `cplean` says "Formalization of the **algebra** of computational paths"
- The prior publications (DQOR16, RDQO18) use neither term in this exact form

**Action required:** Choose one term and use it consistently. "Calculus" is arguably better (it emphasizes the operational/rewriting aspect), but the bibliography entry for the repository itself must match.

### Section numbering vs. chapter references

The paper uses `\section` (correct for an article) but internal comments still say "chapter" (`%%% Converted from chapters/ch3_rewrite_system.tex (book→article) %%%%`). Some cross-references use `\cref{ch:rewrite-system}` with the `ch:` prefix, suggesting a book-to-article conversion. While this compiles correctly (the labels work regardless of prefix), it's untidy.

### Author percentages

All four authors are listed at 25%. This totals 100%, which is correct per BSL requirements. However, BSL may expect a more granular breakdown if contributions are unequal.

## 4. Lean Syntax Leakage — 30 instances of `\texttt`

For a BSL audience (logicians, not necessarily Lean users), the paper should present results in pure mathematical language. There are **30 instances of `\texttt`** containing Lean-specific identifiers:

**In the confluence proof (§3.6):**
- `\texttt{trans\_cancel\_left/right}`
- `\texttt{GroupoidConfluence}`
- `\texttt{HasJoinOfRw}`
- `\texttt{HasConfluencePropExpr}`

**In the applications section (§8):**
- `\texttt{Fibration.lean}`
- `\texttt{CoveringSpace.lean}`
- `\texttt{CoveringClassification.lean}`
- `\texttt{LongExactSequence.lean}`
- `\texttt{HopfFibration.lean}`
- `\texttt{Hurewicz.lean}`, `\texttt{HurewiczTheorem.lean}`
- `\texttt{BlakersMassey.lean}`
- `\texttt{MayerVietoris.lean}`
- `\texttt{CobordismTheory.lean}`, `\texttt{CobordismRing.lean}`
- `\texttt{BottPeriodicity.lean}`, `\texttt{KTheory.lean}`
- `\texttt{AlgebraicKTheoryPaths.lean}`
- `\texttt{SpectralSequence.lean}`, `\texttt{AdamsSpectralSequence.lean}`
- `\texttt{MorseTheory.lean}`, `\texttt{MorseHomology.lean}`, `\texttt{HandleDecomposition.lean}`
- `\texttt{SheafificationPaths.lean}`, `\texttt{SheafCohomologyPaths.lean}`, `\texttt{DerivedSheaves.lean}`
- `\texttt{SpectrumTheory.lean}`, `\texttt{StableHomotopy.lean}`, `\texttt{StableStems.lean}`
- `\texttt{ModelCategory.lean}`, `\texttt{QuillenAdjunction.lean}`
- `\texttt{VectorBundle.lean}`, `\texttt{PrincipalBundle.lean}`, `\texttt{CharacteristicClass.lean}`

**In the formalization design section (§10.2):**
- `\texttt{HasJoinOfRw}` (typeclass name)
- `\texttt{HasConfluencePropExpr}` (instance name)

**Action required:** Either:
- Remove all `\texttt` references and replace with mathematical descriptions, or
- Confine Lean-specific details to a dedicated "Formalization Notes" appendix/subsection

The second option is probably better — Section 8's "Catalog of Advanced Formalized Results" currently reads like a repository index rather than mathematical exposition.

---

## 5. Missing Content / Coverage Gaps

### The codebase has grown far beyond what the paper describes

The top-level `ComputationalPaths/` directory now contains **101 entries** spanning:

- **Algebraic geometry:** `Perfectoid/`, `Prismatic/`, `Crystalline/`, `Etale/`, `Motivic/`, `DAG/`, `GIT/`, `Moduli/`, `Birational/`, `Log/`
- **Representation theory:** `Langlands/`, `KacMoody/`, `GeometricSatake/`, `RepStability/`, `GRT/`
- **Higher category theory:** `InfinityCategory/`, `HigherCategory/`, `Kan/`, `Simplicial/`, `Enriched/`
- **Quantum / physics:** `Quantum/`, `TFT/`, `Mirror/`, `SymplecticDuality/`, `Floer/`
- **Tropical geometry:** `Tropical/`, `TropicalGeometry/`
- **Condensed mathematics:** `Condensed/`
- **And more:** `Padic/`, `NCG/`, `VertexAlgebra/`, `HomologicalStability/`, `Cluster/`, `Intersection/`, etc.

**None of these are mentioned in the paper** except in the brief "Catalog of Advanced Formalized Results" (§8.4), which itself only covers cobordism, K-theory, spectral sequences, Morse theory, sheaves, stable homotopy, model categories, and characteristic classes.

**Recommendation:** This is actually fine for a focused BSL article — the paper should not try to survey the entire codebase. However:
- The statistics should be updated to reflect the full scope
- The conclusion should mention the breadth of the library more accurately
- Consider adding a sentence like: "The full repository extends well beyond the scope of this paper, covering [list key areas], totaling 905 files and over 10,500 theorems."

### Formalization status table is stale

The table in Section 10.2 marks several results as "PS" (Partially Scaffolded):
- $\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}$
- Seifert–van Kampen
- $\pi_1(\Sigma X) = 0$
- Hurewicz, Excision/Blakers–Massey, Mayer–Vietoris

However, **there are 0 `sorry` declarations in the entire codebase**. This means either:
1. These results have been fully formalized since the table was written (most likely), or
2. "Partially Scaffolded" means something other than "contains sorry" (e.g., definitions are present but proofs are axiomatized via `axiom` or `opaque`)

**Action required:** Re-audit each result's status and update the table. If everything is now fully formalized, say so — it's a much stronger claim.

---

## 6. BSL Formatting

### Length

The paper is approximately **190 KB of TeX**, likely producing **50+ pages**. BSL (Bulletin of the Section of Logic, University of Łódź) typically publishes articles of 20–40 pages. This paper may need to be:
- Split into two parts (Part I: §1–§5, Part II: §6–§10), or
- Significantly condensed (especially §8 "Catalog" and the full rule listing in Appendix A)

### BSL template compliance

Comparing against `BSLStyle/template.tex`:

- ✅ Uses `\documentclass[manuscript]{BSLstyle}`
- ✅ Has `\AuthorEmail` for all four authors
- ✅ Has `\Affiliation` entries
- ✅ Has `\Funding`, `\Conflict`, `\Ethics`, `\UseOfGAI`
- ⚠️ Author share format: uses `{25}` for all four, which sums to 100. OK.
- ⚠️ `\AuthAbbrv{b}` — this uses format (b) = "Arthur Freitas Ramos *et al.*" in the header. Appropriate for 4 authors.
- ⚠️ No ORCID numbers provided (the template shows these as optional but encouraged)

### `\UseOfGAI` Declaration — CRITICAL ETHICAL ISSUE

The paper declares `\UseOfGAI{Not used.}`

The git log shows commits like:
```
expand: proof net and effect path constructions
expand: module and monoid path constructions
expand: deep HoTT structural path constructions
expand: deep categorical structural path constructions
...
```

The review itself was conducted by an AI assistant (me). If **any** AI tools were used in:
- Generating Lean code
- Drafting paper text
- Converting between formats (the comments show "Converted from chapters/ch3_rewrite_system.tex")
- Expanding the codebase

...then this declaration must be updated to accurately describe the AI involvement. BSL requires honest disclosure.

**Action required:** Review the `UseOfGAI` declaration and update it to accurately reflect any AI tool usage in preparing the paper or the formalization.

## 7. Specific Errors, Typos, and Unclear Passages

### Errors

1. **Rule count "75" should be "77"** throughout (abstract, §3, §9, appendix). See §1 above.

2. **Appendix A final remark** mentions "the earlier convention of 76 in [RDQO18]" — this is confusing. The actual discrepancy is 77 vs 75, not 76 vs 75. The remark attributes the difference to double-counted context congruence and "two additional transport rules," but the real extras are `trans_cancel_left` and `trans_cancel_right`.

3. **R74 in Appendix Group VIII** says "context_congr" which is "already listed as R31." This means R74 is a duplicate, which would make the total 74 unique rules (if we accept 75) or 76 unique (if we accept 77). The numbering is confused.

4. **Statistics table** (Section 10.2): All numbers are stale. See §1 above.

5. **"over 856 files and 217,000 lines"** (§8 opening) — should be ~905 files and ~216,000 lines.

### Typos and minor issues

6. **§1.5 (Related Work), Cubical Type Theory paragraph:** The citation [CCHM18] is placed after a sentence about computational paths offering "an alternative computational semantics" but the sentence structure makes it look like [CCHM18] supports that claim, when actually [CCHM18] is a reference to CCHM cubical type theory. Rewrite for clarity.

7. **Definition 2.3 (Transitivity):** "where $\mathbin{+\!\!+}$ denotes list concatenation and $\cdot$ is transitivity of $\Eq$." The use of $\cdot$ for both path composition (`p \comp q`) and Eq.trans is overloaded — consider distinguishing notation.

8. **Theorem 2.13(i):** "fst(prodMk(p, q)) = p (strictly, by functoriality); snd(prodMk(p, q)) reduces to q via a single rewrite step." The asymmetry between fst (strict) and snd (rewrite step) should be explained more clearly — *why* is one strict and the other not?

9. **§6.3 (Eckmann–Hilton proof):** The notation $\equiv_3$ is used without definition. Define it as "the existence of a connecting Derivation₃ cell" or use existing notation.

10. **§7.1 (PathExpr bridge):** "When no generators are added, PathExpr_A merely re-encodes Path_A" — this is slightly misleading. PathExpr has more constructors (atom, symm, trans, congrArg, map₂, context operations) while Path is a flat list+proof. The encoding preserves semantics but not structure.

11. **§8 opening:** The framed URL box uses `\fbox{\url{...}}` which may not render well in all PDF viewers. Consider BSL's preferred citation style for software.

### Style issues

12. **Excessive use of "we"** in passive-voice-preferring journal. BSL house style should be checked.

13. **Definition/Theorem numbering:** The paper uses continuous numbering (Definition 1.1, Theorem 1.7, Definition 2.1, etc.) which is appropriate for BSL. However, cross-references sometimes use the chapter-label prefix (e.g., `\cref{ch:rewrite-system}`) suggesting a book origin.

14. **Proof of Theorem 3.15 (Confluence):** Mentions "the typeclass `HasJoinOfRw`" — this is Lean jargon. Replace with: "a parameterized interface for join witnesses."

---

## 8. Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Original mathematical contribution:** The computational paths framework — building higher-dimensional structure atop UIP via rewrite traces — is genuinely novel and well-motivated.

2. **The strict monoid laws** (Theorem 2.4) are an elegant consequence of the list-based representation. The contrast between strict and non-strict laws is well-presented.

3. **The confluence proof** via groupoid algebra (avoiding Newman's lemma) is a real technical contribution that deserves more prominence.

4. **Honest treatment of triviality:** Remark 3.9 (RwEq is the total relation in the UIP setting) and Remark 5.10 (contractibility via proof irrelevance) are admirably forthright about the limitations of the approach.

5. **Massive formalization:** 905 files, 10,500+ theorems, 0 sorries is extremely impressive.

### Weaknesses

1. **The paper is too long** for BSL and tries to cover too much ground. The "Catalog of Advanced Formalized Results" (§8.4) reads like a repository README, not a research article.

2. **The stale statistics** undermine the paper's credibility on the formalization front, which is ironic given that the formalization is actually *much larger* than claimed.

3. **The Lean syntax leakage** makes parts of the paper inaccessible to a pure-logic audience.

4. **The 75-vs-77 rule count** is a factual error that permeates the entire paper and should have been caught.

5. **The `UseOfGAI` declaration** needs review.

### Verdict

The core mathematical contribution (§1–§5) is strong and publishable. The paper needs:

- **Mandatory fixes:** Update statistics, fix rule count, scrub Lean syntax, review UseOfGAI
- **Strongly recommended:** Shorten to BSL page limits (consider splitting), update formalization status table
- **Nice to have:** Expand the confluence proof exposition, tighten the Eckmann–Hilton presentation

With these revisions, the paper would be a solid contribution to BSL.
