This work would have not been possible without the help of many people. First, I can point the never-ending dedication of my parents, Neide and Valdez. Despite facing many hardships in life, they always valued my education, supporting and encouraging my studies. For this, I am eternally grateful. You are my role models and my heroes. I thank my wife, La\'is, for her patience, love and support. Without her, it would be impossible to write this work. I also thank my advisor, Professor Ruy de Queiroz. He has been in this journey with me for 5 years, since the end of my undergraduate studies. I have learned a great deal from him and he has shown me true wisdom. Last but not least, I thank God for giving me patience, strength and resilience every time I asked.
